# CS-305-Software-Security
Term 23EW2

#Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial was the client for this project. They required a comprehensive assessment of their software's security vulnerabilities. The main issue they wanted us to address was to identify and rectify potential security weaknesses in their software to enhance its overall security posture.

#What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I conducted a thorough and systematic assessment of the software's security vulnerabilities. This involved identifying weaknesses, deploying secure encryption algorithms, generating trusted certificates, and implementing secure communication protocols. It is crucial to code securely because it helps protect sensitive data, ensures the confidentiality and integrity of information, and prevents security breaches. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall wellbeing by safeguarding its reputation, customer trust, and financial stability.

#What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The deployment of secure communication through HTTPS and TLS protocols proved to be challenging, particularly the server configuration and certificate installation. However, these challenges were valuable learning experiences, as they required careful implementation and adherence to industry-standard best practices.

#How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by implementing AES-256 encryption, meticulous certificate generation, and checksum verification. In the future, I would continue to use industry-standard best practices and tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to assess vulnerabilities. The decision on mitigation techniques would depend on the specific vulnerabilities identified, their severity, and the best practices recommended for addressing them.

#How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I conducted rigorous functional testing to ensure the code and software application were functional and free from defects. Additionally, I utilized OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party components. Regular code reviews and testing ensured that we did not introduce new vulnerabilities during the refactoring process.

#What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used resources like the Java KeyStore (JKS) tool, cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256), and industry-standard best practices for secure coding. These resources and practices will be invaluable in future assignments or tasks that involve secure software development and vulnerability assessment.

#Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I can showcase my ability to conduct a comprehensive vulnerability assessment, implement industry-standard security measures, and ensure the functionality and security of a software application. I can also demonstrate my proficiency in using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check Maven and my understanding of secure coding practices, which are highly valuable skills for future employers in the field of software development and cybersecurity.
